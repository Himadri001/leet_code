  ////Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.

In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.
Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 2nd position to 4th position 
is 12.
   let curr_sum = 0;
   for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        curr_sum = arr[i];

        // try all subarrays starting with 'i'
        for (let j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (curr_sum == sum) {
                document.write("Sum found between indexes "+i+" and "+(j - 1));
                return;
            }
            if (curr_sum > sum || j == n)
                break;
            curr_sum = curr_sum + arr[j];
        }
    }
